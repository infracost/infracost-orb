        description: If your repo has multiple Terraform projects or workspaces, define them in a config file (https://www.infracost.io/docs/config_file/) and set this input to its path.

      post_condition:
        description: |
          A JSON string describing the condition that triggers pull request comments, can be one of these:
          - `'{"has_diff": true}'`: only post a comment if there is a diff. This is the default behavior.
          - `'{"always": true}'`: always post a comment.
          - `'{"percentage_threshold": 0}'`: absolute percentage threshold that triggers a comment. For example, set to 1 to post a comment if the cost estimate changes by more than plus or minus 1%.
        default: '{"has_diff": true}'
